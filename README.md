## ðŸ“– Goal:
* The goal of this project was to understand and interpret the nature of terrorism efficiently and comprehensively with the use of data visualizations. A visualization which can be used to calculate the total number of attacks, total kill counts and location based on the selected region and year provides interactive interface to explore this dataset. Users can understand various patterns, trends and correlation in terrorism through visual interpretation and its provided explanation.
